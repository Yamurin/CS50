 the user decides how many # in height the pyramid has (between 1 and 8)
	reprompt if not between 1 and 8

loop until i reaches height
i = 0, i < height, i++
print spaces the amount of times of (height - i)
then print  # * height + i

then if height = 2
i = 0
[ ] [ ] #
[ ] ##

print # * height (horizontally)

until the last line contains just 1

to print X 3 times:
for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
	print X
	// XXX

XXO - height - 1
XOO - height - 2
OOO - height - 3
