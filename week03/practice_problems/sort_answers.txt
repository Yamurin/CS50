sort1 uses: BUBBLE SORT
How do you know?: It takes less time with an already sorted list.

sort2 uses: MERGE SORT

How do you know?: it takes less time with a random or unsorted list.

sort3 uses: SELECTION SORT

How do you know?: Logically, it's the last option left. And we can infer it's correct because it took a similar time than buble sort with an unsorted list.
